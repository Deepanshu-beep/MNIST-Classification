# MNIST-Classification
This NoteBook Contains the code for MNIST Classification using Keras Dataset.
You can also Upload your Handwritten image using PIL Library and then passing it in getAnswer() function in the code to verify it.
I prefer to upload image of 28x28 Pixels size for more accurate results.
